This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Pagination is of different types.
On searching an API, first we get some set of results and a  "LOAD MORE" button .
On clicking button further results are loaded and a "LOAD MORE" button at the button. It goes on and on untill there is no more page and data to display.
